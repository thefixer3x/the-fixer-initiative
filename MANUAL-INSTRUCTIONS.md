# MANUAL VPS DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUCTIONS
# Due to terminal JSON parsing interference, follow these manual steps:

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO TAKE:

### 1. Open a NEW Terminal Window/Tab
The current terminal session appears to have MCP/JSON parsing interference.
Open a fresh terminal and navigate to this directory:

```bash
cd /Users/seyederick/CascadeProjects/fixer-initiative-aggregator
```

### 2. Test SSH Ports Manually
Try these commands one by one in the new terminal:

```bash
# Test port 2222 (most common alternative)
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29

# Test port 22000 (Hostinger common)
ssh -p 22000 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29

# Test port 2200
ssh -p 2200 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29

# Test port 22022
ssh -p 22022 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29
```

### 3. Test API Endpoints
If SSH doesn't work, test the API:

```bash
# Test main API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "https://api.hostinger.com/v1"

# Test VPS specific API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "https://api.hostinger.com/v1/vps"

# Verbose API test
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN" \
       -H "Accept: application/json" \
       "https://api.hostinger.com/v1/hosting"
```

### 4. Run the Diagnostic Scripts
In the new terminal, run:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Run comprehensive diagnostic
./run-diagnostics.sh

# Run Node.js version
node node-diagnostics.js

# Check results
cat vps-diagnostic-results.txt
cat api-test-results.json
```

### 5. Alternative Access Methods

#### Hostinger Control Panel:
- Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
- Login with your account
- Find your VPS in the dashboard
- Use web console if available
- Check server status and logs

#### If VPS is unresponsive:
- Check for maintenance notifications
- Try restarting via control panel
- Contact Hostinger support
- Check billing/account status

## EXPECTED RESULTS:

### SSH Success Indicators:
- Connection accepted without "connection refused"
- Key authentication works
- You get a shell prompt
- Can run basic commands (hostname, uptime, etc.)

### API Success Indicators:
- HTTP 200 responses
- JSON data returned
- Server information visible
- No authentication errors (401/403)

### Troubleshooting:
- SSH "Connection refused" = Service down or different port
- SSH timeout = Server may be down or firewall blocking
- API 401/403 = Token issues or insufficient permissions
- API timeout = Network or server issues

## FILES CREATED FOR YOU:
- run-diagnostics.sh - Comprehensive bash diagnostic
- node-diagnostics.js - Node.js version with better error handling
- ssh-port-scanner.sh - Focused SSH port testing
- api-comprehensive-test.sh - API endpoint tester
- hostinger-vps-mcp.js - MCP server for ongoing management

Run these in a FRESH terminal to avoid the JSON parsing interference affecting this session.
