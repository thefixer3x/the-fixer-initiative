**Assistant:**

1. Previous Conversation:
The user initiated the task by providing a PostgreSQL database backup file (`db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup`) and a comprehensive set of instructions for analyzing and reorganizing it to enhance project management capabilities. The user outlined a six-step systematic approach: schema analysis, requirements assessment, data model design, performance optimization, security implementation, and creation of a migration strategy. The conversation began with my attempt to restore the database backup, which failed. This led to the discovery that the backup file is a plain-text SQL dump, which shifted the analysis approach from database restoration to direct file parsing. I created a to-do list to track the high-level tasks and began the schema analysis.

2. Current Work:
The current focus is on the first major task: **Perform Complete Schema Analysis**. After determining the backup file's format, I successfully read its contents and began parsing it to understand the database structure. I used the `search_files` tool with the regex `CREATE TABLE` to identify all table definitions across all schemas (`auth`, `client_services`, `credit`, `public`, `realtime`, `storage`, etc.). This provided a complete list of tables. Following that, I searched for all `FOREIGN KEY` constraints to map the relationships and dependencies between these tables. The most recent action was to analyze these foreign key relationships, which revealed that `auth.users` is a central table and `public.company_projects` is the core of the existing project management functionality. The immediate next step was to delve deeper into the structure of the project-related tables to assess normalization.

3. Key Technical Concepts:

- **PostgreSQL:** The database system being analyzed.
- **Plain-text SQL Dump:** The format of the provided backup file. This was a critical discovery that dictated the analysis methodology, moving from database restoration to direct file parsing.
- **Schema Analysis:** The core activity of the current phase, involving the identification of tables, schemas, their relationships, and data flow patterns.
- **Database Schemas:** The database is organized into multiple schemas: `auth`, `client_services`, `credit`, `public`, `realtime`, `storage`, `supabase_functions`, and `supabase_migrations`. The `public` and `client_services` schemas have been identified as the most relevant.
- **Regex Search:** Using regular expressions (`CREATE TABLE`, `FOREIGN KEY`) with the `search_files` tool is the primary method for extracting structural information from the SQL dump file.
- **Foreign Key Constraints:** These are being used to map the relationships and dependencies between tables, forming a picture of the overall data model.

4. Relevant Files and Code:

- **File:** `/Users/seyederick/Downloads/db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup`
  - **Summary:** This is the single source of truth for the database structure. It's a plain-text SQL file containing all schema definitions, table creations, and data. All analysis is being performed by parsing this file.
  - **Important Code Snippet (Foreign Key Example):** The search for `FOREIGN KEY` returned 114 results, which are being used to map the database schema. An example showing the link between services and projects is:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE ONLY public.company_services
        ADD CONSTRAINT company_services_project_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES public.company_projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
    ```

5. Problem Solving:

- **Problem:** Initial attempts to restore the database backup using `pg_restore` failed.
- **Resolution:** The error message from `pg_restore` ("input file appears to be a text format dump") was key to identifying the file as a plain-text SQL dump. This led to a successful strategy pivot to direct file analysis using file system tools, avoiding the need for a live database instance.

6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:

- **Task 1:** Perform Complete Schema Analysis. This is the current, in-progress task.
- **Next Step:** The immediate next step is to analyze the structure of the core project management tables (`company_projects`, `company_services`, `vortex_items`) to identify normalization opportunities and potential denormalization for performance. This involves reading their `CREATE TABLE` definitions from the backup file.
- **Verbatim Quote of Last Action:**
  > I have now analyzed the entire database backup file, including the definitions of the `company_projects`, `company_services`, and `vortex_items` tables, as well as their foreign key relationships. This has given me a solid understanding of the current schema and its structure.
  >
  > Here's a summary of my findings and analysis:
  >
  > ### Schema and Relationship Analysis
  >
  > - **`public.company_projects`**: This table serves as the central entity for projects. It contains essential project information such as `name`, `description`, and `type`. The presence of an `api_key` column suggests a design where each project has its own unique key for access control, which is a robust security practice.
  > - **`public.company_services`**: This table has a clear many-to-one relationship with `company_projects`, where each project can have multiple associated services. The `config` column, being of `jsonb` type, offers flexibility but also carries the risk of data inconsistency if not managed with care.
  > - **`public.vortex_items`**: This table also has a many-to-one relationship with `company_projects`, but the foreign key column is named `company_id`. This inconsistency in naming (`company_id` vs. `project_id`) is a key area for improvement to ensure clarity and maintainability. The `type` and `status` columns, being text-based, are prime candidates for normalization.
  >
  > ### Normalization and Denormalization Opportunities
  >
  > Based on my analysis, I've identified several opportunities for normalization to improve data integrity and consistency:
  >
  > 1. **Project Types**: The `type` column in [`company_projects`](../Downloads/db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup:4973) should be normalized. I propose creating a `project_types` table and replacing the text field with a foreign key. This will enforce a controlled vocabulary for project types and make the system more maintainable.
  > 2. **Service Statuses**: Similarly, the `status` column in [`company_services`](../Downloads/db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup:4990) should be normalized into a `service_statuses` table.
  > 3. **Vortex Item Types and Statuses**: The `type` and `status` columns in [`vortex_items`](../Downloads/db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup:6263) should also be normalized into their own respective tables.
  > 4. **Consistent Naming**: I will rename the `company_id` column in [`vortex_items`](../Downloads/db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup:6263) to `project_id` to align with the naming convention in [`company_services`](../Downloads/db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup:4990) and to more accurately reflect the relationship with `company_projects`.
  >
  > At this stage, I do not see an immediate need for denormalization. The current schema is reasonably normalized, and any performance considerations can be addressed later through indexing and query optimization.
  >
  > ### Next Steps: Indexing and Query Patterns
  >
  > The next logical step is to analyze the existing indexing strategy and infer potential query patterns. A well-defined indexing strategy is crucial for performance, especially as the database grows. I will now search for all `CREATE INDEX` statements in the backup file to get a complete picture of the current indexing landscape. This will help me identify any missing or redundant indexes and inform my recommendations for performance optimization.
  >
  > I will now search for `CREATE INDEX` statements in the backup file.
>
  > ```

  > <args>
  > <file_pattern>db_cluster-14-10-2025@02-26-55.backup</file_pattern>
  > <path>/Users/seyederick/Downloads</path>
  > <regex>CREATE INDEX</regex>

**Assistant:**

I have now completed a thorough analysis of the database's indexing strategy, which concludes the initial "Perform Complete Schema Analysis" phase of this project. The presence of 155 indexes, including those on foreign key relationships and specialized indexes for full-text search, indicates a mature and well-optimized database.

### Indexing and Query Pattern Analysis

My analysis of the `CREATE INDEX` statements has revealed a comprehensive indexing strategy across all schemas. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Foreign Key Coverage**: The database has excellent indexing on foreign key columns, which is critical for the performance of `JOIN` operations. This is a strong foundation to build upon.
- **Specialized Indexes**: The use of GIN indexes for full-text search and hash indexes for specific equality checks demonstrates a sophisticated approach to performance tuning.
- **Project-Related Indexes**: The core project management tables (`company_services` and `vortex_items`) have indexes on their foreign key columns that link them to `company_projects`. This is good, but there is room for improvement. I have identified a lack of indexes on columns that are likely to be used in `WHERE` clauses, such as `status` and `type`.

Based on this analysis, I will be recommending the creation of new indexes on the `company_projects`, `company_services`, and `vortex_items` tables to support more efficient querying for project management tasks.

### Next Steps: Assessing Project Management Requirements

With the schema analysis complete, I am now moving on to the next major phase of the project: **Assess Project Management Requirements**. This is a critical step in designing a data model that not only meets the immediate needs of the business but is also scalable and adaptable for the future.

My approach for this phase will be as follows:

1. **Evaluate Current Capabilities**: I will assess how the existing schema supports the project lifecycle, from initiation and planning to execution and completion.
2. **Identify Gaps**: I will identify the gaps in the current data model related to project tracking, resource allocation, and timeline management.
3. **Analyze Multi-Tenancy**: I will analyze the requirements for multi-tenant data isolation and partitioning to ensure that the new data model can securely and efficiently support multiple clients.

I will now update the to-do list to mark the completion of the schema analysis and to reflect that I am now beginning the requirements assessment phase.

**Assistant:**

I am now beginning the "Assess Project Management Requirements" phase. To design an effective project management system, I need to thoroughly understand the desired capabilities. I will start by outlining a series of questions to clarify the requirements for project lifecycle management, resource allocation, and multi-tenancy.

This structured approach will ensure that the final data model is comprehensive and aligns with the business's strategic objectives.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>To design a robust project management system, I need to understand your specific requirements. Could you please clarify the following points?

1. **Project Lifecycle**: What are the distinct stages of a project in your workflow (e.g., 'Planning', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'On Hold')?
2. **Task Management**: Do you need to track individual tasks within projects? If so, what information is essential for each task (e.g., assignee, due date, status, dependencies)?
3. **Resource and Team Management**: How do you envision managing teams and assigning resources to projects? Is there a need for role-based access control within a project (e.g., Project Manager, Developer, Viewer)?
4. **Multi-Tenancy**: How do you need to separate data between different clients or tenants? Is a single-database, schema-per-tenant, or a fully isolated database-per-tenant approach preferred?</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>1. **Lifecycle**: Planning, In Progress, Review, Completed. 2. **Tasks**: Yes, we need to track tasks with assignee, due date, and status. 3. **Teams**: We need role-based access with Project Managers and Team Members. 4. **Multi-Tenancy**: We prefer a single database with row-level security to separate client data.</suggest>
<suggest>1. **Lifecycle**: Conception, Development, Testing, Deployment. 2. **Tasks**: No, we only need to track the overall project status. 3. **Teams**: Simple team assignments per project are sufficient. 4. **Multi-Tenancy**: We need a separate schema for each client to ensure data isolation.</suggest>
<suggest>1. **Lifecycle**: Active, Inactive. 2. **Tasks**: Yes, but only with a title and a completed/not completed status. 3. **Teams**: No team management features are needed. 4. **Multi-Tenancy**: A completely separate database for each tenant is required for compliance reasons.</suggest>
<suggest>Our requirements are flexible. Please propose a solution based on industry best practices for a SaaS application.</suggest>

**Assistant:**

Thank you for the clarification. Based on your request for a solution grounded in industry best practices for SaaS applications, I will now outline a comprehensive project management system. This proposal will serve as the foundation for the enhanced data model.

### Proposed Project Management Requirements

Here is a summary of the requirements that will guide the design of the new data model:

1. **Project Lifecycle Management**: To provide flexibility, I propose a customizable, stage-based project lifecycle. The system will include default stages such as `Planning`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Completed`, and `On Hold`, but administrators will have the ability to define custom stages to fit their specific workflows.

2. **Hierarchical Task Management**: The system will support a hierarchical structure for tasks. Each `Project` can contain multiple `Tasks`, and each `Task` can be broken down into `Sub-tasks`. This allows for granular tracking of work. Each task will have the following attributes:
    - `Assignee`: The user responsible for the task.
    - `Due Date`: The target completion date.
    - `Status`: The current state of the task (e.g., `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`).
    - `Priority`: The urgency of the task (e.g., `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Urgent`).
    - `Dependencies`: The ability to link tasks that must be completed in a specific order.

3. **Team and Resource Management**: The system will feature robust team management capabilities with role-based access control (RBAC). `Teams` can be created and assigned to `Projects`. Within each project, users can be assigned specific roles, such as:
    - `Project Manager`: Full control over the project, including task assignment and project settings.
    - `Team Member`: Can view and update assigned tasks.
    - `Viewer`: Read-only access to the project.

4. **Multi-Tenancy and Security**: To ensure data isolation and security in a multi-tenant environment, I will implement a single-database architecture with Row-Level Security (RLS). This is a scalable and cost-effective approach that leverages the existing capabilities of PostgreSQL and Supabase. Each project and its related data will be owned by a specific organization, and RLS policies will ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to see.

### Next Steps: Designing the Enhanced Data Model

With these requirements defined, I will now proceed to the next phase: **Design Enhanced Data Model**. I will create the necessary `CREATE TABLE` statements for the new project management tables and define the relationships between them and the existing schema.

I will now update the to-do list to reflect the completion of the requirements assessment and the beginning of the data model design.

**Assistant:**

I will now design the enhanced data model for the project management system. This will involve creating several new tables and defining their relationships. I will start by creating a new file named `project_management_schema.sql` to house the DDL statements for the new schema.

This file will contain the `CREATE TABLE` statements for the following tables:

- `project_stages`
- `task_statuses`
- `task_priorities`
- `teams`
- `team_members`
- `project_teams`
- `tasks`
- `sub_tasks`
- `task_dependencies`

I will now create the `project_management_schema.sql` file.

**Assistant:**

I have successfully created the `project_management_schema.sql` file, which contains the DDL statements for the new project management tables. This file defines the structure of the new data model and includes default values for the normalization tables.

### Next Steps: Performance and Scalability

With the data model now designed, the next logical step is to focus on **Optimize Performance & Scalability**. A well-designed schema is only effective if it can perform efficiently under load.

My plan for this phase is as follows:

1. **Partitioning Strategy**: I will analyze the new tables and recommend a partitioning strategy for large datasets, such as the `tasks` and `sub_tasks` tables.
2. **Indexing Strategy**: I will design a comprehensive indexing strategy for the new tables to ensure that project-related queries are highly performant.
3. **Real-Time Analytics**: I will outline a plan for supporting real-time project analytics and reporting, which may involve the use of materialized views or other techniques.

I will now update the to-do list to reflect the completion of the data model design and the beginning of the performance and scalability phase.

**Assistant:**

I am now beginning the "Optimize Performance & Scalability" phase. I will create a new file, `performance_and_scalability_plan.sql`, to outline the strategies for partitioning, indexing, and real-time analytics.

This file will contain the recommended `CREATE INDEX` statements for the new project management tables and will also include comments detailing the proposed partitioning strategy and a plan for real-time analytics using materialized views.

<write_to_file>
<path>performance_and_scalability_plan.sql</path>
<content>
-- Performance and Scalability Plan

-- 1. Partitioning Strategy
-- For large datasets, especially in a multi-tenant environment, partitioning is key to maintaining performance.
-- The `tasks` and `sub_tasks` tables are expected to grow significantly.

-- Recommendation: Partition the `tasks` table by `project_id`. This will allow the database to efficiently
-- query tasks for a specific project without having to scan the entire table. This is particularly effective
-- in a SaaS environment where queries are often scoped to a single tenant or project.
-- The implementation of partitioning can be done using PostgreSQL's declarative partitioning.
-- Example (conceptual):
-- CREATE TABLE tasks ( ... ) PARTITION BY LIST (project_id);
-- CREATE TABLE tasks_project_1 PARTITION OF tasks FOR VALUES IN (1);
-- CREATE TABLE tasks_project_2 PARTITION OF tasks FOR VALUES IN (2);

-- 2. Indexing Strategy
-- A comprehensive indexing strategy is crucial for query performance. The following indexes are recommended
-- for the new project management tables to support common query patterns.

-- Indexes for `tasks` table
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_project_id ON public.tasks(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_assignee_id ON public.tasks(assignee_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_status_id ON public.tasks(status_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_priority_id ON public.tasks(priority_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_due_date ON public.tasks(due_date);
-- Composite index for filtering tasks by project and status
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_project_status ON public.tasks(project_id, status_id);

-- Indexes for `sub_tasks` table
CREATE INDEX idx_sub_tasks_parent_task_id ON public.sub_tasks(parent_task_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sub_tasks_assignee_id ON public.sub_tasks(assignee_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sub_tasks_status_id ON public.sub_tasks(status_id);

-- Indexes for junction tables
CREATE INDEX idx_team_members_user_id ON public.team_members(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_teams_team_id ON public.project_teams(team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_task_dependencies_depends_on ON public.task_dependencies(depends_on_task_id);

-- 3. Real-Time Analytics and Reporting
-- To support real-time analytics and dashboards without putting a heavy load on the primary database,
-- we can use materialized views to pre-aggregate data.

-- Recommendation: Create a materialized view to provide a summary of project health.
-- This view can be refreshed periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) to provide near real-time data.

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW public.project_health_summary AS
SELECT
    p.id AS project_id,
    p.name AS project_name,
    COUNT(t.id) AS total_tasks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ts.name = 'To Do' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS tasks_to_do,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ts.name = 'In Progress' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS tasks_in_progress,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ts.name = 'Done' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS tasks_done,
    MAX(t.updated_at) AS last_task_update
FROM
    public.company_projects p
LEFT JOIN
    public.tasks t ON p.id = t.project_id
LEFT JOIN
    public.task_statuses ts ON t.status_id = ts.id
GROUP BY
    p.id;

-- To keep the data fresh, the materialized view should be refreshed periodically.
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW public.project_health_summary;

**Assistant:**

I have successfully created the `performance_and_scalability_plan.sql` file, which outlines the strategies for partitioning, indexing, and real-time analytics. This completes the "Optimize Performance & Scalability" phase.

### Next Steps: Security and Access Control

The next critical phase is to **Implement Security & Access Control**. A robust security model is essential for a multi-tenant SaaS application to ensure data privacy and integrity.

My plan for this phase is as follows:

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: I will design and implement RLS policies to enforce project-based access control. This will ensure that users can only access data related to the projects they are a part of.
2. **Role-Based Permissions**: I will define role-based permissions for different project stakeholders (e.g., Project Manager, Team Member, Viewer) to control their actions within a project.
3. **Audit Compliance**: I will create a strategy for auditing changes to project data to ensure compliance and accountability.

I will now create a new file, `security_and_access_control.sql`, to define the RLS policies and role-based permissions.

**Assistant:**

I am now beginning the "Implement Security & Access Control" phase. I will create a new file, `security_and_access_control.sql`, to define the RLS policies and role-based permissions for the new project management system.

This file will contain the SQL statements to enable RLS on the relevant tables and create the policies to enforce project-based access control.

<write_to_file>
<path>security_and_access_control.sql</path>
<content>
-- Security and Access Control Plan

-- 1. Enable Row-Level Security (RLS)
-- RLS must be enabled on all tables that contain project-specific data.

ALTER TABLE public.teams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.team_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.project_teams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.sub_tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.task_dependencies ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Define Helper Functions
-- These helper functions will simplify the RLS policies.

-- Function to check if a user is a member of a project.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_project_member(user_id UUID, project_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM public.project_teams pt
        JOIN public.team_members tm ON pt.team_id = tm.team_id
        WHERE pt.project_id = is_project_member.project_id AND tm.user_id = is_project_member.user_id

    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 3. RLS Policies for Project Management Tables

-- Policies for `tasks` table
CREATE POLICY "Allow project members to view tasks" ON public.tasks FOR SELECT

CREATE POLICY "Allow project managers to delete tasks" ON public.tasks FOR DELETE
USING (has_project_role(auth.uid(), project_id, 'Project Manager'));

-- Policies for `teams` and `team_members` (assuming teams are managed at a higher level, e.g., by organization admins)
-- For simplicity, we'll allow any authenticated user to create teams, but only team members to view them.
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to create teams" ON public.teams FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow team members to view their teams" ON public.teams FOR SELECT
USING (EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.team_members tm WHERE tm.team_id = id AND tm.user_id = auth.uid()
));

-- 4. Audit Compliance
-- To ensure audit compliance, we will create a trigger-based auditing system.
-- A new table, `project_audit_log`, will store a record of all changes to project-related tables.

CREATE TABLE public.project_audit_log (

**Assistant:**

I have successfully created the `security_and_access_control.sql` file, which defines the RLS policies and an audit trail system for the new project management features. This completes the "Implement Security & Access Control" phase.

### Next Steps: Create Migration Strategy

The final phase of this project is to **Create Migration Strategy**. A well-defined migration plan is essential to ensure a smooth transition from the current schema to the enhanced data model with minimal downtime.

My plan for this phase is as follows:

1.  **Phased Implementation**: I will develop a phased implementation plan that allows for a gradual rollout of the new features.
2.  **Data Migration Procedures**: I will design the data migration procedures to move existing data to the new tables and to populate the new normalization tables.
3.  **Rollback Procedures and Testing**: I will create a rollback plan and a testing protocol to ensure data integrity and to minimize the risk of data loss.

I will now create a new file, `migration_strategy.md`, to document the migration plan.

**Assistant:**

I am now beginning the final phase: "Create Migration Strategy". I will create a `migration_strategy.md` file to document the entire process.

This markdown file will provide a step-by-step guide for migrating the database, including pre-migration steps, the migration process itself, and post-migration verification.

# Migration Strategy for Enhanced Project Management System

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the existing database schema to the new, enhanced project management data model.

## 1. Overview

The migration will be conducted in a phased approach to minimize downtime and risk. The process will involve creating the new schema, migrating existing data, and then switching over to the new system.

## 2. Pre-Migration Steps

1.  **Backup the Database**: Before beginning the migration, a full backup of the production database must be taken.
2.  **Test in a Staging Environment**: The entire migration process must be tested in a staging environment that is a replica of the production environment.
3.  **Notify Users**: Inform users of the scheduled maintenance window during which the migration will take place.

## 3. Migration Process

The migration will be executed through a series of SQL scripts.

### Phase 1: Schema Creation

1.  **Apply the New Schema**: Execute the `project_management_schema.sql` script to create the new tables and normalization data.
2.  **Apply Performance Optimizations**: Execute the `performance_and_scalability_plan.sql` script to create the necessary indexes and materialized views.
3.  **Apply Security Policies**: Execute the `security_and_access_control.sql` script to enable RLS and create the security policies.

### Phase 2: Data Migration

1.  **Normalize Existing Data**: Migrate the distinct values from the `type` and `status` columns in the old tables to the new normalization tables (`project_stages`, `task_statuses`, etc.).
2.  **Migrate Projects and Tasks**: Write and execute SQL scripts to migrate the data from the `company_projects`, `company_services`, and `vortex_items` tables to the new `projects`, `tasks`, and `sub_tasks` tables.
3.  **Create Teams and Assign Members**: Based on the existing user and project data, create default teams and assign users to them.

### Phase 3: Switchover

1.  **Deploy a new version of the application** that is compatible with the new schema.
2.  **Put the application into maintenance mode**.
3.  **Perform the final data sync** to migrate any data that has changed since the initial migration.
4.  **Switch the application to use the new database schema**.
5.  **Bring the application out of maintenance mode**.

## 4. Rollback Procedure

In the event of a critical failure during the migration, the following rollback procedure will be initiated:

1.  **Restore the Database**: Restore the database from the backup taken in the pre-migration step.
2.  **Revert Application Code**: Roll back the application to the previous version that is compatible with the old schema.
3.  **Notify Users**: Inform users that the maintenance has been extended and that the system is being restored.

## 5. Post-Migration Verification

After the migration is complete, the following steps must be taken to verify its success:

1.  **Data Integrity Checks**: Run a series of SQL queries to ensure that all data has been migrated correctly.
2.  **Functionality Testing**: Perform a full regression test of the application to ensure that all features are working as expected.
3.  **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of the database and application to ensure that the new schema is performing as expected.
