# Migration Strategy for Enhanced Project Management System

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the existing database schema to the new, enhanced project management data model.

## 1. Overview

The migration will be conducted in a phased approach to minimize downtime and risk. The process will involve creating the new schema, migrating existing data, and then switching over to the new system.

## 2. Pre-Migration Steps

1.  **Backup the Database**: Before beginning the migration, a full backup of the production database must be taken.
2.  **Test in a Staging Environment**: The entire migration process must be tested in a staging environment that is a replica of the production environment.
3.  **Notify Users**: Inform users of the scheduled maintenance window during which the migration will take place.

## 3. Migration Process

The migration will be executed through a series of SQL scripts.

### Phase 1: Schema Creation

1.  **Apply the New Schema**: Execute the `project_management_schema.sql` script to create the new tables and normalization data.
2.  **Apply Performance Optimizations**: Execute the `performance_and_scalability_plan.sql` script to create the necessary indexes and materialized views.
3.  **Apply Security Policies**: Execute the `security_and_access_control.sql` script to enable RLS and create the security policies.

### Phase 2: Data Migration

1.  **Normalize Existing Data**: Migrate the distinct values from the `type` and `status` columns in the old tables to the new normalization tables (`project_stages`, `task_statuses`, etc.).
2.  **Migrate Projects and Tasks**: Write and execute SQL scripts to migrate the data from the `company_projects`, `company_services`, and `vortex_items` tables to the new `projects`, `tasks`, and `sub_tasks` tables.
3.  **Create Teams and Assign Members**: Based on the existing user and project data, create default teams and assign users to them.

### Phase 3: Switchover

1.  **Deploy a new version of the application** that is compatible with the new schema.
2.  **Put the application into maintenance mode**.
3.  **Perform the final data sync** to migrate any data that has changed since the initial migration.
4.  **Switch the application to use the new database schema**.
5.  **Bring the application out of maintenance mode**.

## 4. Rollback Procedure

In the event of a critical failure during the migration, the following rollback procedure will be initiated:

1.  **Restore the Database**: Restore the database from the backup taken in the pre-migration step.
2.  **Revert Application Code**: Roll back the application to the previous version that is compatible with the old schema.
3.  **Notify Users**: Inform users that the maintenance has been extended and that the system is being restored.

## 5. Post-Migration Verification

After the migration is complete, the following steps must be taken to verify its success:

1.  **Data Integrity Checks**: Run a series of SQL queries to ensure that all data has been migrated correctly.
2.  **Functionality Testing**: Perform a full regression test of the application to ensure that all features are working as expected.
3.  **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of the database and application to ensure that the new schema is performing as expected.
