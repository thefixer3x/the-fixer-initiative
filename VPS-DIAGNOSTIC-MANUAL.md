# VPS Diagnostic Results - Manual Investigation
# Generated: $(date)

## Current Status
- **VPS IP**: 168.231.74.29
- **Ping Status**: ✅ Responding (confirmed earlier)
- **SSH Standard Port (22)**: ❌ Connection refused
- **API Token**: ✅ Available in environment

## SSH Port Investigation Strategy

Based on the connection attempts, here are the ports to test:

### High Priority SSH Ports:
1. **Port 2222** - Common alternative SSH port for VPS providers
2. **Port 22000** - Often used by Hostinger for custom SSH
3. **Port 2200** - Alternative SSH configuration
4. **Port 22022** - Extended SSH port range

### SSH Connection Commands to Try:
```bash
# Test each port manually:
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29
ssh -p 22000 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29  
ssh -p 2200 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29
ssh -p 22022 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29

# If successful, run diagnostics:
ssh -p [WORKING_PORT] -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vps root@168.231.74.29 "
  echo '=== VPS System Information ==='
  hostname
  uptime
  free -h
  df -h
  systemctl status sshd
  netstat -tlnp | grep :22
"
```

## API Endpoint Investigation

### Primary API Endpoints to Test:
1. **https://api.hostinger.com/v1** - Main API
2. **https://api.hostinger.com/v1/vps** - VPS specific
3. **https://api.hostinger.com/v1/hosting** - Hosting services
4. **https://rest-api.hostinger.com/v2** - Alternative API base

### API Test Commands:
```bash
# Test main API endpoint:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "https://api.hostinger.com/v1"

# Test VPS endpoint:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "https://api.hostinger.com/v1/vps"

# Test with verbose output:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN" \
       -H "Accept: application/json" \
       "https://api.hostinger.com/v1/hosting"
```

## Alternative Access Methods

### 1. Hostinger Control Panel
- **URL**: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
- **Features**: Web-based VPS console, restart options, monitoring
- **Access**: Login with your Hostinger account

### 2. VPS Recovery Console  
- Available through Hostinger control panel
- Direct console access even if SSH is down
- Can restart services and check system status

### 3. API Management
- Use curl commands above to check VPS status
- Restart services via API if available
- Monitor resource usage

## Diagnostic Tools Available

I've created several diagnostic tools in your workspace:

1. **ssh-port-scanner.sh** - Tests multiple SSH ports
2. **api-comprehensive-test.sh** - Tests all API endpoints
3. **comprehensive-vps-diagnostic.sh** - Full system diagnostic
4. **hostinger-vps-mcp.js** - Node.js MCP server for API management

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Immediate**: Try SSH on port 2222 and 22000 (most likely to work)
2. **API Testing**: Use curl commands to test API endpoints
3. **Control Panel**: Check https://hpanel.hostinger.com/ for server status
4. **If All Fail**: Contact Hostinger support - server may need maintenance

## Status Indicators to Look For

### SSH Success Indicators:
- Connection accepted
- Password/key authentication successful  
- Shell prompt appears
- Can run basic commands (hostname, uptime)

### API Success Indicators:
- HTTP 200 response
- JSON data returned
- Server information in response
- No authentication errors

### Signs of Issues:
- Connection timeouts
- "Connection refused" errors
- HTTP 401/403 responses
- Empty/error responses from API
