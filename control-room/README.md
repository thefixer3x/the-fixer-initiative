# The Fixer Initiative

A centralized control system for managing multiple Supabase projects efficiently.

## Mission
Consolidate multiple Supabase projects into a single, cost-effective control hub while maintaining project isolation and monitoring capabilities.

## Structure
- `control-room/` - The main control interface and monitoring dashboard
  - `frontend/` - React/Vite dashboard application
  - `supabase/` - Database schemas, migrations, and edge functions
  - `shared/` - Shared client SDK for all connected apps

## Projects to be Consolidated
1. Vortexcore.app - Main aggregation platform
2. SEFTEC Store - E-commerce platform
3. SaaS Platform - Software as a Service
4. Apple Store Lekki - Retail management

## Getting Started
See [control-room/README.md](control-room/README.md) for setup instructions.
